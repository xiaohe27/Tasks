Testing Packages

Before uploading packages to DataMill, running them on your local computer saves time down the road.

Download the virtual worker listed on the homepage.
Install VirtualBox
Import the downloaded ova file as an appliance File -> Import Appliance
Adjust the number of virtual CPUs Settings -> System -> Processor
Start the virtual machine
Upload your test package with Dropbox
Obtain a link for your test package Right Click -> Dropbox -> Share Link
Follow the instructions for running a test package in the virtual machine
After the virtual worker reboots from the benchmark to the controller press Alt+F2 to switch to another terminal
Check for the benchmark results results under /tmp
Creating an Experiment Package

An experiment package contains the source code for the benchmark and DataMill specifc scripts. The DataMill specific scripts are named setup.sh, run.sh, and collect.sh. They set up, execute, and collect the results from the experiment respectively. To run Coremark on DataMill, the setup script would decompress the source code for Coremark and compile it:

setup.sh

#!/bin/sh
tar xaf coremark_v1.0.tgz
make -C coremark_v1.0 compile
The first line extracts coremark_v1.0.tgz, which is included with the experiment package. The second line compiles the benchmark program with its makefile. In general, the setup script handles decompression, compilation, and dependency installation for the experiment. DataMill also supports the installation of software packages with Gentoo's emerge command.

run.sh

#!/bin/sh
make -C coremark_v1.0 run1.log
The run script executes the experiment. This example saves the results for Coremark in run1.log.

collect.sh

#!/bin/sh
results="coremarkv1.0-$(hostname)-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M).tar.gz"
tar czf $results coremark_v1.0/run1.log > /dev/null 2>&1
echo $results
The collect script gathers results that experiment produced. tar czf $results coremark_v1.0/run1.log > /dev/null 2>&1 compresses the results file into a tarball while supressing output from tar czf $results coremark_v1.0/run1.log. The last line echos the path to the results tarball.
