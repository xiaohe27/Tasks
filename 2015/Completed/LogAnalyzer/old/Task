Do the following experiments:
1. Hack into Monpoly and test the amount of events inside
2. Check the amount of events using my log analyzer, and compare

3. Use grep to check the base execution time of extracting the insert events (whole regex, same as the one
used in my java prog so that comparison can be made)

4. Write the output directly to file (with ASCII encoding) instead of to std output and then redirect to file 

Use some small eg which can obtain results quickly, and then compare the accuate difference
