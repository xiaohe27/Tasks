I haven't thought of a good name for the repository, but the 
project is ready to be incorporated to runtimeverification on github now.

The rvm specification for monitoring the Monpoly's delete-1-2 property
can be found in directory `examples\ComplexFormula\Delete12`.

The original Monpoly Style formula can be found at 
`examples\ComplexFormula\Delete12\MonpolyStyleFormula`

It is OK to monitor small log files (like the file `delete.log` 
in the same directory), but when the log becomes huge, the formula
with unbounded future temporal operator becomes non-monitorable.
We cannot decide whether a liveness property is violated until we 
reach the very end of the log file. Therefore it needs to maintain 
a large amount of data inside heap, and it will throw memory out of
bounds exception if the log file is big enough...

Another interesting thing in this example is:
In order to monitor that Monpoly's property, we need to
take into account the relationships between the states of 
multiple monitors. Details about my thoughts can be found 
at `\LogAnalyzer\limitationOfExisitingLogPlugins\relationsBetweenEventsOnDifferentObjects`
