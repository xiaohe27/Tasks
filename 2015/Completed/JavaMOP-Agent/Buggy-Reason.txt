using -agent option will be ok.
when using -agent, add one more thing "&& BaseAspect.notwithin();" to the MOP_CommonPointCut

pointcut MOP_CommonPointCut() : !within(com.runtimeverification.rvmonitor.java.rt.RVMObject+) && !adviceexecution()&& BaseAspect.notwithin();

If I manually add that additional condition to the pointcut's definition, then previous exception will disappear, and all the tests that I did can be passed.
