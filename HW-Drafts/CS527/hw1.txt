Difficulties:

1. Accuracy of performance measure
When I try to measure the performance (w.r.t. execution time) of a program which reads a large amount of data from hard disk, 
I intended to have multiple tests with the same parameters to obtain more convincing statistics. 

However, due to some optimization of hardware etc. (like disk caches), the first execution will cost significantly more time, which affects the reliability of the experiments.

My temporary solution is using some Unix commands after each run to clean all the caches, but I wonder whether there exists some tools, preferably cross-platforms ones, that can do this job conveniently.

2. Test case generation
In the past, when I developed a piece of code, I only performed a limited number of tests. Therefore, many corner-cases may be missed. The insufficient tests increases the risk of failures when feeding with certain inputs. The reason that I am often not able to provide good coverage of tests is my limited skills in generating test cases. What I did is picking up some tests in mind and wrote some ad-hoc
