I agree that some properties are not as effective as others.

I'm not the author of those properties and I'm not trying to defend them;

For the properties that are reported to have false alarms, I've investigated some, and for one of them,
I made a pull request to the repository property-db about half year ago, but never got replied.

For the current role of JavaMOP in the toolchain, it simply split the instrumentation (.aj) from the monitor specification (.rvm spec),

so it is relatively easy to check whether JavaMOP's translation is correct manually, given the original .mop spec is not complex.

It is likely that the monitoring code generated by RV-Monitor is faulty, but for the reported properties that I have inspected,

all the problems are inside the .mop spec. 

For example, I just figured out the issue #228 is due to a typo in the .mop spec.

I'll provide the property that I improved when I have time.
