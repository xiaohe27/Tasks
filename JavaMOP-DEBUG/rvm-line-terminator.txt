Several test cases in current ere plugin project use '\n' as line terminator in the 
expected string value. This is fine for unix like systems because the line terminator on 
those systems is haphazardly also '\n'. But on windows it is "\r\n", which makes the tests 
fail. 

Different system may have their different line terminator, therefore, this should be 
designed as plat-form dependent instead of hard-coded using the convention on one 
particular platform.
