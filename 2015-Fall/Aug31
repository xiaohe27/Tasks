From Owolabi:

I suggest to fully document this (and any other) restriction(s) on .mop file names in at least three places?:

In the code comments right before the areValidNames in JavaMOPMain.java
In the error message, of the areValidNames method, so that non-members of our team know why their .mop file names are not being accepted
In the README inside the property-db repository where we store our properties
