The events about events.

A meta event is not going to generate/index any monitor directly.

Instead, it decides what kind of actual event should be fired based on
the concrete values of certain fields, and then fire the corresponding more
concrete events.

For example,

insert(?user, ?db, ?value) is a raw/meta event, based on the value of field db,
we can fire the actual event 
insertDB1(someVal1) 
OR
insertDB2(someVal2)

(The user field is useless in this example.)


Internal (private) event:
can only be invoked from within the body of other event action method, but 
not directly invoked by the runtime monitor.

And the private method name does not need to be modified to avoid conflict.
It should be the spec designers' responsibility to avoid naming conflicts.
