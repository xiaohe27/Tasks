The events about events.

A meta event is not going to generate/index any monitor directly.

Instead, it decides what kind of actual event should be fired based on
the concrete values of certain fields, and then fire the corresponding more
concrete events.

For example,

insert(?user, ?db, ?value) is a raw/meta event, based on the value of field db,
we can fire the actual event 
insertDB1(someVal1) 
OR
insertDB2(someVal2)

(The user field is useless in this example.)
