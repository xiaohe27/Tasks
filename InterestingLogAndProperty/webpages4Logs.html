 <h3>From Internet</h3>
  It is hard to find real logs directly on a website due to the confidentiality issue.
  The commerial companies are eager to collect logs but not sharing them.

<br/><br/>

  Some free sample log files can be found on the Internet, such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/ffdd7079-47be-4277-921f-7a3a6e610dcb.mspx"> W3C extended log file</a> or 
  <a href="http://www.monitorware.com/en/logsamples/apache.php">Apache (Unix) log samples </a>

  <br/>
  However, the website only provides simple interpretation of the fields but no property is given.

  <br/>
  <h3>Past experience on log analysis</h3> <br/>
