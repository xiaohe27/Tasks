What direction should we make main efforts?

1. Logs that record the program execution traces.

2. Logs in general. Clients may perform SQL like query.


***
My opinion: our RV-Monitor is more event-driven. In the area of log analysis,
it is good at analyzing the logs that reflect the program's execution, and ensuring 
the recorded method invocations conform to good programming practice.

When analyzing whether a program conforms to good programming practices, we do not
care too much about the object ID (name) that invoke the methods, as long as the 
set of methods that related by the same object happen in certain order so that 
the given good programming practice can be satisfied.

trade-off between expressive power and efficiency.

shortcomings of rv-monitor:

equality reasoning.
