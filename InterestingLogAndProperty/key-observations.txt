1. Huge logs should be stored in data warehouse.
Unlike database which we can dynamically update, data warehouse is static and fixed.

2. RV-Monitor is an event-driven tool and 

its existing logic plugin can only express the properties about control flow.

i.e. whether the events related by common fields (whose values are used as
indices of monitors) of certain objects occur in such an order that it conforms
to the property.

The particular values of non-indexing fields of an object are not important when 
we analyze the control flow property. As long as different objects can be distinguished.

E.G property p:
Before next() is called on an iterator 'iter', hasNext() should always be called.

This property is implictly universally quantified: forall iter:Iterator, 
the property p(iter) should hold.

Therefore, we do not care about the iterator's name/field values. All we care is whether
the 'hasNext' and 'next' events related to the same iterator satisfy the property.

=============================
However, if the log is data-driven and needs sql-like query, we existing logic plugin
is not power enough.
