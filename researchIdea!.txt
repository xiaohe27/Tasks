1. split the huge log into n pieces, where n is the number of nodes

2. each node knows the property to be checked and each node checks 
its piece of log independently. report some violations if found.

3. each node generate a report of its log section (may include the 
statistics of each events, the time range etc.)

4. according to the property, each node transmit the events (in compressed form)
that other nodes may need to other nodes.

The routing algo is another topic.
In bus structure, it can be transferred to left/right

5. each node receive some info from all the necessary other nodes, 
and do the checking again.
