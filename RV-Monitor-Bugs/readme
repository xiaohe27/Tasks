The monitors generated from an rvm spec containing multiple properties are not correct.
E.G. Given two fsm formulas in one spec, two transition functions will be generated, however,
the update of the monitor states is messed up: only one state var is keeping track of monitor states 
instead of two. 

Conceptually, the event alphabets are shared among the fsm, the correct monitoring should be:
when an event 'a' occurs, both fsm1 and fsm2 use it to update their internal states.

In the current implementation, only one state var is used, so the effect is eq to 
a single fsm receive two consecutive event 'a'
