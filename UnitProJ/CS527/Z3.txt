for finding the range of the int expr
(n * (n+1))/2

My z3 constraint is:

; This example illustrates basic arithmetic and 
; uninterpreted functions

(declare-const n Int)
(declare-const s Int)
(assert (= s (/ (* n (+ n 1)) 2) ))
(assert (<= s 2147483647))

(declare-const n2 Int)
(assert (= n2 (+ n 1)))
(declare-const s2 Int)
(assert (= s2 (/ (* n2 (+ n2 1)) 2) ))
(assert (> s2 2147483647))

(check-sat)
(get-model)

(exit)
