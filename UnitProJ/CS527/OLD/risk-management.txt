1. The format of input is still subject to change.

In general, the input should be the annotated java source code.
However, the syntax of the annotation has not been decided yet.

2. The choice of Java parser.
In order to extract useful info from the java source code and gen
the desired spec, it is essential to get the correct AST from a given java source code.

Potential risks:
There are several different parsers for java, and we are not familiar with 
them and do not know the strengths and weaknesses of different available tools.

Suggestion: do a meta study on the available java parsers and then choose the one that
best fit our project.

3. The underlying spec accepted by K verifier might change.
Sol: fix the version of K and its verification framework being used in this project.
