Seems that AST in K has been re-organized by 

instance method first, 
then static method.

in each category, ordered by alphabetical order.


=====================================================
some structures:

visit 'NoMethodBody
visit 'ClassBodyDecList
visit 'MethodDec
visit 'MethodDecHead
visit 'accCT
visit 'Public
visit 'staticCT
visit 'None
visit 'class_
