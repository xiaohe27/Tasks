Seems that AST in K has been re-organized.

Methods are traversed in reversed order!

===
The method order extracted in first phase can still be from left to right.
The total number of methods is stored, so that when the id of the method in the
second phase can be mapped to the right method in the ast produced by the first phase.

say total number of methods is N

In phase 2, the No. x method is mapped to No. (N - x) method in the output ast of phase 1.
