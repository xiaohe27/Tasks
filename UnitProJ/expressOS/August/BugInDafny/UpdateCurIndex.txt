If an additional arg newPos:int is added, then verified.
Otherwise, it'll report one error.

However, if we only analyze the path that caused the error, 
no error is found!

Dafny sucks!!!
For a precond that requires some var 'v' to be 
0 <= v <= N, it reports one error

However, the same method with condition 0 <= v < N, and with v == N,
both can be verified independently!
