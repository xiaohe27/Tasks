If two correct lemmas (defined in the same class), and neither is used,
then only one unused lemma can be verified quickly.

If they are defined in module level, then no problem at all.

=======
Timeout occur if too many lemmas are put inside the class level,
move them to module level is fine.
=======
Important:
ensure for each while loop, specifying the modifies frame accurately!!!

===========
ensure updateSeq works
