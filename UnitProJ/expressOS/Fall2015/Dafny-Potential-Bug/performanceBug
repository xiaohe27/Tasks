Adding an assertion (through pre/post or assert statement in the method body) at method A may have significant influence on the time used to prove some other method B.

This is quite annoying and unpredictable if not look into the source code of Dafny.

additional lemmas may slow down the proof dramatically.

using assertions sometimes speedup, sometimes slows down the proof.
