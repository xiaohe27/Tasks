split the problem to several smaller sub-problem and conquer them separately.

1. updateSeq's preCond ==> LI
2. {LI && loop guard} <updateCurIndex> {LI}
3. {LI && !loop guard} ==> updateSeq's postCond

***
should always assure that the len of the seq is >= any index it refers to,
identify the bounds!!! similar that lower bound.
