No need to have the ghost var spine ...
it is enough to ensure head is valid, given that INode's valid requires its 
next node is valid...

***
Each time we ensure a node is valid, add it to a set,
that set + curNd == curNd.footprint

--------------
Use lemma!
head is Valid indicates that all the nodes in its footprint are valid!

Try not to use the spine field...

================================
lemma:
in a list of nodes, node i's next is node i+1
then if node i is valid, then all the nodes after it are valid, and
are in the footprint of node i
