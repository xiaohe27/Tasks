It seems that the directory from which we compile the .aj file can affect the generated byte code of the aspects!

Therefore, the -d option needs to be used when executing javamop in the experiment of comparing generated agent jars.

E.G.
javamop -agent -d ajOut *.mop

Then a single .aj file will be generated in ajOut dir
Use that .aj file when executing javamopagent

javamopagent ajOut/MultiSpec_1MonitorAspect.aj classes

Finally, the agent.jar generated by javamopagent has the same contents as agent.jar 
generated by javamop's -agent option.

P.S.
diff still reprots these two binary files differ.
But if you unpack these two .jar in different folders, say, old and new respectively,
and then compare the contents of these two folders using 'diff -r old new', no difference can be found.
