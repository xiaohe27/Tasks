when using ocamlc instead of ocamlopt
the efficiency of execution decreased a lot

ocamlc : produce byte code which will be executed on ocaml's vm
slower, executable has smaller size

ocamlopt : gen native code object files ~ standalone
bigger executable, and much faster!

Monpoly read log entry one by one, it cannot detect error in the middle immediately
The memory consumed by Monpoly is quite small
