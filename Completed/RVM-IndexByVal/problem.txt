1. a spec may have N parameters, but in an event, maybe only N-M parameters
are provided (maybe not in the same order as defined in the original map).
how to retrieve the monitor(s) correctly and efficiently, while adding new monitor
to the original map if necessary?

2. Given partial parameters, then we might retrieve multiple monitors. 
And all the retrieved monitors need to be updated by the event.
