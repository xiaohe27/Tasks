Title: Commutativity Race Detection

Abstract:
I will give a presentation of a PLDI '14 paper which introduced
the concept of commutativity races.

I will begin by a simple example from the paper to illustrate the
look and feel of a commutativity race. Then I'll use a slightly
larger example to show how to use commutativity specification and
vector clocks to check whether a program execution trace has 
commutativity races. After that, I will present the main algorithm
for commutativity race detection and discuss how the difference in
commutativity specification's representation can affect the complexity
of the algorithm. Finally, I will briefly introduce the logical fragment ECL, 
which is proposed by the authors to describe the commutativity specification;
and also the procedure that translates the ECL specification to the actual 
data structures that are used in the commutativity race detection algorithm.
