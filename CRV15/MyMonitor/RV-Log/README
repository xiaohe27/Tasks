After running install.sh, a folder called RV-Log will be extracted from the archive.

The run.sh is the script that runs the tool.

The first two arguments of "run.sh" should trace file and specification file resp.

The command line options include -events, -witness and -trace can be placed after
the two required arguments, in any order. The effects of these options follow the requirements
on the wiki.

The monitor for monitoring the specification can be created by the run.sh script by simply removing
the last two lines (The last two lines invoke the monitor to do the real monitoring).
