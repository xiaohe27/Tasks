*Use stack to maintain the monitors 

*keep an alarm in each local monitor.

*periodically (e.g. every 100 events) remind the top monitor in the stack to check its alarm (the one whose alarm will ring at first)

*if the required event did happen in time, then remove the top item, owise report violation and terminates.

*If at the end of the log the stack of monitor is not empty, then check its top monitor with the latest time.
