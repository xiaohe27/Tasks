1. Logic plugin is an non-parameterized automata generator. It reads an rvm spec as input and produces an automata which behaves as a decision procedure that 
judges whether a given non-parameterized trace satisfies the property described in the spec.

2. Whether we can get a total automata depends heavily on the spec that rv-monitor reads; and I strongly argue that it is NOT a good idea to 
make some predefined transitions. We should NOT make decisions for the users. I prefer the design of 'garbage in garbage out'.
Whether we should provide a hint when no total automata can be produced from the given spec is a separate issue.

3. Given the time intervals associated with each event are disjoint, the produced automata should be deterministic.
However, in online and offline monitoring, it is difficult to obtain the same trace based on the current design.

The online monitoring uses watch-dog, which will generate an explicit timeout event;
if that timeout event is not present in the offline log, then the online trace will differ from the offline trace.
