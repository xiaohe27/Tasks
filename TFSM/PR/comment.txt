This pull request shows the current progress on the timed fsm logic plugin.
Based on previous discussion @grosu about the tfsm plugin, a prototype has been designed.
The plugin is still under development, but the following things have been done:

1. parsing of TFSM syntax proposed by @grosu

2. some unit test that checks the syntax parsing.

3. a hand-crafted example (with manually written monitoring code) that demonstrates the online monitoring with time constraints.

E.g. to illustrate the syntax of TFSM:

   tfsm :
     start [
        next -> unsafe
        hasnext -100> safe
     ]
     safe [
        next -200> start
        hasnext -> safe 
     ]
     unsafe [
        next -> unsafe
        hasnext -200>20> safe
     ]

In the unsafe state part, 
transition hasnext -200>20> safe means the event hasnext 
is expected to happen within the time interval [20, 200] since the system enters unsafe state.

Things going to do:

1. Monitor Code generation

2. Example of monitoring offline logs with timed events

The design intent is to provide a uniform api for both online and offline monitoring by 
adding an additional time field to the event methods when the TFSM plugin is used, so that 
the timed events can be accepted by monitors no matter how the time-stamps of the events 
are obtained: in on-line monitoring, clients can query the current time; in offline 
monitoring, the time of events can be directly parsed from the log entry.
