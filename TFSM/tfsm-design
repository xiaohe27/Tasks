special timeout event which will be triggered automatically 
if none of the other events are fireable.

two modes:
one with watchdog (time-driven, active monitoring), 
and the other use event-driven approach (passive monitoring, suitable for offline monitoring). 

My opinion:
It is hard to achieve the same semantics for time-driven (real time) and event-driven (logical time).

Consider in the event-driven approach the lazy check method:
whenever some timed event comes, append its id to the a queue, where the elements in the queue
will be periodically picked up to check time. if there is no timeout happened, then do not remove,
otherwise remove it.
