*Universal api for event actions that incorporate the time attribute.
As a result, both online/offline clients can provide timed events
via the same methods.

Implement a decision procedure in rvm.rt such that
given the event name and its occurrence time point,
it can decide whether that event happens at the valid 
time interval. The monitor keeps track of the current 
state and a map that whose sig is state * event -> time interval
