Design:
For each state, at most one watchdog will be created based on the least upper bound of the max waiting time of the events.

say at state s,
s [
e1 ->[2,7] s1
e2 ->[3,9] s2
timeout -> s3
] 

the timeout will occur after 9 ms in state s

If some event does not have a finite max waiting time, then no watchdog will be created.

Assume there are totally 5 states,
then at most 5 watchdogs need to be created for each monitor.


suppose monitor m change state from s to s',
then it will be removed from the watchdog for state s and 
added to watchdog for state s'
