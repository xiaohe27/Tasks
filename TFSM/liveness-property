The time constraints can be considered as liveness property.
In interactive systems where the system does not halt, the liveness property is undecidable in gengeral.
E.G. for a property with no time constraint on event A at state S, 
even if the event B at state S has time constraints; we cannot decide whether the system stuck at state S violate the liveness property.

If the spec is ideal in the sense that all events at all states are properly annotated with time constraints.
Then we can actively monitor the time constraints.
* start a timer for each monitor, after the max transition time passed, it begin to alarm.

If the program terminates, we may also use the lazy approach:
* when the program terminates, invoke an additional time check with the current time (or maybe the max time which is represented as Long.MAX_VALUE) and
 check whether any active monitors can find some violation.
