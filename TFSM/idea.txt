Two applicable domains:
A: online monitoring: use real world time
B: offline monitoring: use the timestamps associated with the event.

info from the tfsm formula:
time interval within which an event is fireable in a given state.

tfsm :
     start [
        next ->[0,5] unsafe
        hasnext ->[0,5] safe
     ]
     safe [
        next ->[2,15] start
        hasnext ->[0,5] safe 
     ]
     unsafe [
        next -> unsafe
        hasnext -> safe
     ]

The max fire time is associated with each state.
If no event occurs before that max time, then no event will be fireable.

For each timed event check whether the associated time fall inside the fireable time interval. 

idea for online monitoring:
Start a separate thread for counting time when a new monitor is created.
In order to minimize the impact of the monitoring on original system, 
the timer thread should immediately yield to other threads once it finds
that there is still time left.

idea for offline monitoring:
Each time a timed event is observed, check the global monitor timetables to decide whether any timeout occurs
