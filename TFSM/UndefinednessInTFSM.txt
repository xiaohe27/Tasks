what would happen if:

s0 [
e0 ->[2,5] s1
timeout -> s2
]

s1 [
e1 -> [0,2] s2
timeout -> s0
]

s2 [
e2 ->[3,7] s0
timeout -> s1
]

In online monitoring, we can use watchdog to react accordingly in time.
But in offline monitoring, we receive the timed info via reading logs,
so the next received time stamp may accross multiple transitions as defined
in the above semantics.

think about the trace:
s0 (e0,3)-> s1
it is normal well defined transition.

But what if we receive the event e0 after time 100?
error msg for each time-out?
too many err msg caused by the same timeout may distract the users
if they want to find all the unique timeout events.
