For a given state, there won't be any overall time constraint associated with 
it if some transition starting from that state does NOT have any time constraint.

Even though all the other transitions will NOT be able to happen due to 
violations of the time constraints, the unrestricted transition might happen eventually.

***
The monitors maintain a field 'curTime', which is initialized by the
timestamp of its creation time. 

In some special case where the transition starting from start state 
has a lower bound of fire time, special check is needed for the 
very first event to avoid false positives.

For all the other cases, no sepcial checks are needed.
