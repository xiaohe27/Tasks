Multiple processors:

For monitoring multiple-properties 
*Applicability:
Each processor responsible for monitoring one property.
Naive parallelism does not work.
Not applicable for online monitoring.
Though there is no comm overheads, each processor needs to run
at least original system's execution time.
There is no benefits if the proportion of monitoring overheads 
is very low in the original monitoring system.

For offline monitoring, there should be a way to make use of SPMD paradigm.
